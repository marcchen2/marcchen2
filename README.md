### Hello! I'm Marc Chen. 

- I'm currently a visiting ML researcher at the University of Waterloo, where I support the computational finance research of Profs. [Yuying Li](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~yuying/) and [Peter Forsyth] (https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~paforsyt/).
- I recently graduated from uWaterloo with a Master of Mathematics in Data Science, and completed my thesis, titled [A Robust Neural Network Approach to Optimal Decumulation and Factor Investing in Defined Contribution Pension Plans] (https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/19874).

### Highlighted Projects:

#### â€¢ [Market Data Bootstrapper](https://github.com/marcchen2/market_data_bootstrap/)  

This tool was developed as part of a larger ML framework to create optimal portfolio management strategies.
