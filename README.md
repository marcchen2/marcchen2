### Hello! I'm Marc Chen. 

- I'm currently a visiting ML researcher at the University of Waterloo, where I support the computational finance research of Profs. [Yuying Li](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~yuying/) and [Peter Forsyth](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~paforsyt/).
- I recently graduated from UWaterloo with a Master of Mathematics in Data Science, and completed my thesis, titled [A Robust NN Approach to Optimal Decumulation and Factor Investing](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/19874).
- My co-authored ML finance research has been submitted for journal publication, and is available [as a pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10582). 
- On this personal Github, I share select projects from my research experiences and independent side projects.

### Highlighted Projects:

#### â€¢ [Market Data Bootstrapper](https://github.com/marcchen2/market_data_bootstrap/)  

This tool was developed as part of a larger ML framework to create optimal portfolio management strategies.
